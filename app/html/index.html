                  “Room size” defines the Sizez of the circles inscribed in the room’s square. The diameter of the outer circle defines the unit of measurement for the side of the squared room: the bigger the diameter, the smaller the room (e.g.: if the diameter is as long as the room’s side, the room is the smallest possible). For a better 3D effect it is suggested to set “room size” anywhere between 2.00 and 4.00. Below 2.00 sound sources may be too close to each other and sound movement might be too minimal to be perceived, over 4.00 the room may become too big and soft, distant sounds might be inaudible.

               <p>
                  Select between Headphones and Quadraphonic setting. Then select the Output Device and the Sample Rate as desired. If quadraphonic, check the correct wiring of your quad system. (Quadraphonic is obviously recommended, since front and rear spatialization will be lost with headphones.)

               <h3>
                  History and info
               </h3>
               <p>
                  Bounces was originally thought of as an acoustic piece. It was planned to pair another piece – Waves on the Minesweeper, still unperformed – that uses the same instrumental forces and spatial setting. The basic idea was to conceive a score where sounds move fictitiously in the space (i.e. by “passing” the same sound from one instrument to its neighbors). At the same time the audience could freely walk around the musicians and experience a movable hearing point. Practical reasons (i.e. the “unperformed” expectations) pushed me to convert the original plan into something else, totally free from musician-related hindrances. Thus, I asked programmer Rafael Vega to elaborate an ambisonic environment and a GUI to make the listener’s experience more immersive and interactive (as if he/she was part of an audience wandering in a public space full of musicians). 
               </p>
               <p>
                  Somehow, the original project was intrinsically planned to be rendered that way. Thus, the result you see is not meant to be a piece of software on top of a musical composition, but rather one sole sound object. While a stage and a theater are the places where an orchestra usually happens to perform, Bounces’ music and its interface are instead intimately connected and cannot be severed.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Bounces is formally constituted of seven white-noise interludes of decreasing length (7 to 1 seconds) and seven “expansions” of increasing length, one after each interlude. At each expansion the sound irradiates all over the room, bounces against the walls and gets trapped inside the instrumental sections of the orchestra. Since each expansion starts with an ever louder dynamic and the walls of the virtual room, acting as absorbing panels, reduce the initial amplitude of the sound at each bounce, the overall duration of the expansion is determined by the evolution of the dynamic levels. Minimal “melodies” pop up at random points in the room.
